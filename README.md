# MultimodalGenreClassification

We combined the different modes
of musical information given by the Music4All dataset
lyrics, audio, and audio features to predict the genre associated with songs. This involved various methods
of pre-processing and network architectures to produce the
best individual models for each mode or data source. These individual models were then synthesized using network
fusion and ensemble learning techniques to produce one even
better.
